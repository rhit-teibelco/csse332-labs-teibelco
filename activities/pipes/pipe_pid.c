 * pipe_pid.c
 *
 * Task:
 * =====
 * In this exercise, we would like to child to send its process id back to its
 * parent. Yes we can get it from the return value of fork, but we'd like to
 * have a backup way for getting it as well.
 *
 * HINT 1:
 * =======
 * You might find the functions sprintf, snprintf, and atoi very helpful.
 *
 * HINT 2:
 * =======
 *  Alternatively, remember that everything is just a bunch of bytes.  How many
 *  bytes is an integer?
